      </div>
      <img class="img-flex" src="images/store.jpg" alt="">
      <p><i>Coco's Chocolatiers</i> is in no way affiliated with Disney/Pixar's new film, <i>Coco</i>.</p>
      <p><small>Trust me, if it was, this small store would be making a lot more money than it does currently.</small></p>
      <p>Our store was founded in 1868 by a poor man who had a passion for chocolate. What started out as a poor family business expanded into one of the most successful chocolate retail stores across the continent.</p>
      <p>Our corporate headquarters is located in Arcadia Bay, Oregon, United States. However, there are 250+ locations scattered about the United States and Canada, and a few in Mexico. You can use our location map to find the store closest to you:</p>
